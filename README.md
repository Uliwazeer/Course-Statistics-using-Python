This module provides functions for calculating mathematical statistics of numeric (Real-valued) data.

The module is not intended to be a competitor to third-party libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, or proprietary full-featured statistics packages aimed at professional statisticians such as Minitab, SAS and Matlab. It is aimed at the level of graphing and scientific calculators.

Unless explicitly noted, these functions support int, float, Decimal and Fraction. Behaviour with other types (whether in the numeric tower or not) is 
currently unsupported. Collections with a mix of types are also undefined and implementation-dependent. If your input data consists of mixed types, you 
may be able to use map() to ensure a
consistent result, for example: map(float, input_data).
Statistics, in general, is the method of collection of data, tabulation, and interpretation of numerical data. It is an area of applied mathematics concern with data collection analysis, interpretation, and presentation. With statistics, we can see how data can be used to solve complex problems. 

In this tutorial, we will learn about solving statistical problems with Python and will also learn the concept behind it. Let’s start by understanding some concepts that will be useful throughout the article.

Note: We will be covering descriptive statistics with the help of the statistics module provided by Python.

Understanding the Descriptive Statistics
In a layman’s term, descriptive statistics generally means describing the data with the help of some representative methods like charts, tables, Excel files, etc. The data is described in such a way that it can express some meaningful information that can also be used to find some future trends. Describing and summarizing a single variable is called univariate analysis. Describing a statistical relationship between two variables is called bivariate analysis. Describing the statistical relationship between multiple variables is called multivariate analysis.

There are two types of descriptive Statistics – 

Measure of central tendency
Measure of variability
